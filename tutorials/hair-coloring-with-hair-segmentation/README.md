In this example, we use the on-device, [Image Segmentation API](https://docs.fritz.ai/develop/vision/image-segmentation/android.html) in order change the color of the user's hair.

To get an idea of how to use Hair Segmentation in your app, take a look at [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-android-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/hair-coloring-with-hair-segmentation/app/src/main/java/ai/fritz/haircoloring/MainActivity.java).
